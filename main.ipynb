    "## 1. Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting from MySQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting data from a MySQL database and turning it into a CSV is pretty simple. If you use a language such as Python, you can can grab your data using a query like `SELECT * FROM table_name`. This will return an object where its column names are in the `description` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, you can grab the column names, and append the tuples of the rows to the list, and write out each entry in the list into the csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "conn = mysql.connect(\n",
    "    # credentials\n",
    ")\n",
    "cursor = conn.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM table_name\")\n",
    "rows = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "columns = []\n",
    "for d in rows.description:\n",
    "    # grabs the column name\n",
    "    columns.append(d[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "final = [columns]\n",
    "for r in rows:\n",
    "    final.append(r)\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",

    "## Extracting from MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "This one is a more complicated, because since MongoDB documents are extremely similar to JSON files, they can be nested. SQL databases make it easy, in that both SQL and CSV files don't support arrays, but Mongo is different. First, use a programming language like Python to extract the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the first priority would be to get rid of the nested structures. This would mean that the nested objects/arrays would have to be extracted out into their own relations with a foreign key to their host object. This is similar to the \"link\" process of different pieces of data. Instead of keeping all the data in one document, we would split it with a logical link to the host object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the nests have been broken down to one layer, we can then tackle the schema issue. Since some objects have fields that others don't, we have to group similar objects and make a pool of their keys. This would act as the columns at the top of the csv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, loop through all similar objects, and write each of their values into the csv files, filling in `NULL` or whatever other appropriate missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplist way I can wrap my head around accomplishing this."

    "## 2. Data Inspection, Exception Reporting and Cleansing\n",
    "\n",
    "The order I went about cleaning the data was actually pretty important, as there were foreign keys in some relations that required data in other relations to exist. For example, the Employee_Information and Student_Counceling_Information both had Department ID's as foreign keys, so I had to do the Department_Information first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I have imported a function from `department.py` called `clean_department_info`, that does exactly as it describes. It changes the data that is passed in by removing any entries that have data that is problematic. It also returns the unique department IDs as a list and an object for the exceptions. The exceptions are reported below."
